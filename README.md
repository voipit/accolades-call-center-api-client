# accolades-call-center-api-client
JavaScript client for browser based integration with Accolades (the call management system from [VoIPIT](https://www.voipit.ro)).

More information about this connector can be found on the [documentation website](https://help.accolades.ro/en/api/crmExtern/descriere.php).

The `index.html` file can be uploaded to the Accolades server, using the browser. When a call is processed, the script will output messages to the browser console, using `console.log()` commands. You can edit the script and change the behaviour, to fit your needs.
